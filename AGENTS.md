# AGENTS.md -- Drake_Models

## Safety

- Never merge PRs that fail CI.
- Never use `--admin` to bypass branch protection.
- Never commit secrets, credentials, or API keys.
- Never force-push to `main`.

## Python Standards

- Python 3.10+ with `from __future__ import annotations`.
- Use `python3` not `python`.
- Type hints on all public function signatures.
- Docstrings (Google style) on all public modules, classes, and functions.
- No wildcard imports. No `print()` in `src/` (use logging).

## Architecture Principles

- **TDD** -- Write tests first, then implementation. 100% coverage target.
- **DbC** -- Design-by-Contract: preconditions validate inputs (raise `ValueError`), postconditions validate outputs (raise `AssertionError`).
- **DRY** -- Single source of truth. Geometry, inertia, XML generation defined once in `shared/`.
- **LoD** -- Law of Demeter: callers use public APIs only; never reach into internal data structures.

## Drake-Specific

- **SDFormat (SDF 1.8)** is the model description format.
- **Z-up convention**: vertical axis is Z, forward is X, gravity = (0, 0, -9.80665).
- Bodies are `<link>` elements with `<inertial>`, `<visual>`, `<collision>`.
- Joints: `<joint type="revolute">`, `<joint type="fixed">`, `<joint type="floating">`.
- Model generation produces SDF XML strings; tests verify XML structure without requiring pydrake.
- When using pydrake: `from pydrake.X import Y` (explicit imports, never attribute access on `pydrake`).

## Testing

- `python3 -m pytest tests/ -v` to run all tests.
- Unit tests in `tests/unit/`, integration tests in `tests/integration/`.
- Tests must NOT require pydrake installed -- they verify SDF XML generation only.
- Use `pytest.approx()` for floating-point comparisons.
- No `TODO` / `FIXME` in source unless tracked by a GitHub issue.

## Linting

- `ruff check src scripts tests` -- must pass with zero violations.
- `ruff format --check src scripts tests` -- must pass.
- `mypy src` -- must pass.

## Git Workflow

- Branch from `main`. Branch naming: `fix/issue-XXXX-description` or `feat/description`.
- PRs require CI to pass before merge.
- Commit messages: conventional commits (`feat:`, `fix:`, `test:`, `docs:`, `refactor:`).

## 🧠 Reasoning & Engagement

> This section is managed centrally by Repository_Management and synced fleet-wide.
> Do NOT edit it directly in individual repositories — edit the source in Repository_Management/AGENTS.md.

These rules govern _how_ you engage with a task before and during implementation. They exist because LLM agents tend to pick an interpretation silently, overcomplicate the solution, and edit code they were not asked to touch. Each rule directly counteracts one of those failure modes.

- **Surface ambiguity. Do not guess silently.** If the request has more than one plausible interpretation, list the options and ask before implementing. Picking one and running with it is the single most common cause of rework in this fleet.
- **Push back on overcomplication.** If a simpler approach would satisfy the request, say so before you build the complicated one. Do not implement bloated 1000-line constructions when 100 would do. The senior-engineer test: would they call this overcomplicated? If yes, simplify.
- **Stay surgical.** Every changed line must trace directly to the user's request. Do not "improve" adjacent code, comments, formatting, or imports. Do not refactor things that are not broken. Match existing style even if you would do it differently.
- **Spotted ≠ fix.** If you notice unrelated dead code, latent bugs, or stylistic problems while working, _mention them in the PR body or as a follow-up issue_ — do not fix them in the same PR. (The `mcp__ccd_session__spawn_task` tool is the right channel when working interactively.)
- **Clean up only your own orphans.** If your changes leave imports, variables, or functions newly unused, remove them. Do not delete pre-existing dead code unless the task asked for it.
- **State a verifiable success criterion before coding.** For a bug fix, that's a failing test that reproduces it (RED → GREEN, see TDD section below). For a feature, the explicit check that says "done." "Make it work" is not a success criterion.

**The diff test:** every line in your final diff should answer "this is here because the user asked for X." If you cannot answer that for a given line, remove it.

## 🛑 NETWORK & API HYGIENE (CRITICAL)

> This section is managed centrally by Repository_Management and synced fleet-wide.
> Do NOT edit it directly in individual repositories — edit the source in Repository_Management/AGENTS.md.

### GitHub API Quotas

| API Type                  | Quota        | Consumed By                                                        |
| ------------------------- | ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| REST (`gh api repos/...`) | 5,000 req/hr | Safe for polling                                                   |
| GraphQL                   | 5,000 req/hr | `gh pr list --json`, `gh pr checks`, `gh pr create`, `gh pr merge` |

GraphQL and REST have **separate** quotas. Exhausting GraphQL blocks PR creation and merging fleet-wide for an entire hour.

### Mandatory Rules

- **NO MASS POLLING**: Agents MUST NEVER use `gh pr list`, `gh issue list`, or arbitrary REST/GraphQL loops in a bulk manner to "scan" or "sweep" the repository fleet. Single, scoped repository lookups are allowed when needed (e.g., checking if a specific PR exists).
- **LOCAL FIRST**: Rely on local `.md` files, previously generated `issues.json` artifacts, or user assistance to find task context — do not query GitHub to discover what to work on.
- **NO PARALLELIZED GITHUB CLI**: Never write or execute scripts that loop over multiple repositories performing `gh` operations (automated PR merge scripts, fleet-wide status sweeps, etc.).
- **NO TIGHT POLLING LOOPS**: Never implement `while true; do gh pr checks $PR; sleep 30; done` patterns. Each iteration of such a loop costs 1–3 GraphQL calls; at 30-second intervals that drains the 5,000/hr quota in under 3 hours.
  - ❌ `while true; do gh pr checks; sleep 30; done`
  - ✅ `gh run watch <run-id>` — streams CI events without polling
  - ✅ Check status once at natural work breakpoints (after completing other tasks)
- **BATCHING**: If remote information is absolutely necessary, use a single focused query — not a loop of queries.
- **REST OVER GRAPHQL FOR CI STATUS**: Use REST endpoints for CI polling; they don't consume the GraphQL quota.
  - ❌ `gh pr checks <N>` (GraphQL)
  - ✅ `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/runs` (REST)
  - ✅ `gh api repos/OWNER/REPO/actions/jobs/<id>/logs` (REST)
- **STOP MONITORS IMMEDIATELY**: When using background monitor tasks, call `TaskStop <id>` the moment the monitored condition is satisfied. Do not leave monitors running "just in case."
- **LONG POLLING INTERVALS**: Background monitors must use ≥270-second intervals (keeps the prompt cache warm). Default to 1200–1800 s for idle monitoring. Never chain short sleeps to work around the 60-second minimum.
- **SILENT FAILURES**: If an API rate limit is hit, HALT NETWORK ACTIVITY IMMEDIATELY. Do not write retry-loops that further exhaust the quota. Alert the user and pivot to local work.

### Checking Rate Limit Status

```bash
gh api rate_limit | python3 -c "
import json, sys, datetime
d = json.load(sys.stdin)['resources']
for k in ['core', 'graphql']:
    r = d[k]
    reset = datetime.datetime.fromtimestamp(r['reset']).strftime('%H:%M:%S')
    print(f'{k}: {r["remaining"]}/{r["limit"]} remaining — resets {reset}')
"
```

## 🧭 Repo Context & Codemap Freshness

> This section is managed centrally by Repository_Management and synced fleet-wide.
> Do NOT edit it directly in individual repositories — edit the source in Repository_Management/AGENTS.md.

Use repo-local context before broad exploration:

- Read `AGENTS.md` first, then check `docs/codemap.md` or `docs/operations/codemap_freshness_runbook.md` when present.
- If `.codemap/` exists, treat it as a generated local cache for navigation; verify important claims against source files before editing.
- If `.codemap/` is missing or stale, use source search (`rg`), focused file reads, and tests as the fallback. Report the missing/stale index as a rollout gap instead of blocking unrelated work.
- Do not commit `.codemap/` or `.codemap/index.db`. Codemap indexes are cache/artifact data and must stay ignored.
- To audit local fleet posture, run `python -m scripts.codemap_context_inventory --root .. --format markdown` from `Repository_Management`. This is a local, network-free inventory; it is not a substitute for repo-specific validation.
